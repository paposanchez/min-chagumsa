	Okay and now what?
</p>

<p>
	You have a few options to include this into your project.
</p>

<h4>Bower</h4>
<p>
	<code>$ bower install titatoggle</code>
</p>

<h4>Less</h4>
<p>
	Inside the project you will find <code>_titatoggle.less</code> Include this file into your own project, and stuff just works.
	If needed, you can fiddle around with some less variables.
</p>

<h4>CSS</h4>
<p>
	There is alway the option to include only the <code>titatoggle-dist.css</code>. Keep in mind this thing is build on top off Bootstrap 3.
	<pre><code class="html">
	<link href="css/titatoggle-dist.css" rel="stylesheet">
	</code></pre>
